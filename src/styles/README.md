The GDS Frontend is a mature frontend framework for building government websites. 

It resolves problems of patterns and user experience that would monopolize all available development and testing resources if prioritized in a single project

Implementing GOV.UK Frontend in a service resolves, from a service assessment point of view, technical questions that otherwise need complex consideration. It gives a boost to the service assessment that lets us build the alpha with full stack developers.

- Accessibility
- Responsitivity
- Cross browser consideration
- Consistency of experience with the GOV.UK service standards even if components are differently styled

In OfS we are testing designs that take a step away from GOV.UK. In this section we are subverting the GOV.UK Frontend by re-skinning the basic scheme for our alternative scheme

## React components
One of the major advantages of GOV.UK is the extensive library of code examples and patterns that are already implemented and approved by proxy through the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). 

GOV.UK do not provide React components but using code snippets from here we can build our own component library at speed
